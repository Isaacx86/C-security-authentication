# C-security-authentication
This is a security authentication program, In this program the user will be asked to enter a four digit numerical only code, once the code has been verified as only being 4 digits, it will go back to the main menu option. The second option to encrypt the code they have entered, If it does not compare or match too the encrypted value of 1234 which is 4523, the message that will be displayed tells the user the comparison is not the same, but will still output the encrypted code. The third option for the user should be selected to decrypt the already encrypted number, there are no comparisons here, it will decrypt the code once the user has entered a code and encrypted it, the code cannot be decrypted if the encryption has not been ran in the first place. The fourth option is for counting the amount of successful and unsucessful times the code has been compared too the value of 1234 correctly or incorrectly The fifth and final option is the exiting option, this option will gracefully terminate the application
